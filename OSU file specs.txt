/* Timing Point Syntax:
time,beatLength,meter,sampleSet,sampleIndex,volume,uninherited,effects

time: Start time of the timing section, in milliseconds from the beginning of the beatmap's audio. Ends at the next timing point.
beatLength: This property has two meanings:
	For uninherited timing points, the duration of a beat, in milliseconds.
	For inherited timing points, a negative inverse slider velocity multiplier, as a percentage. For example, -50 would make all sliders in this timing section twice as fast as SliderMultiplier.
This value is calculated as 60000 / BPM
meter: Amount of beats in a measure. Inherited timing points ignore this property.
sampleSet: Default sample set for hit objects (0 = beatmap default, 1 = normal, 2 = soft, 3 = drum).
sampleIndex: Custom sample index for hit objects. 0 indicates osu!'s default hitsounds.
volume: Volume percentage for hit objects.
uninherited: Whether or not the timing point is uninherited.
effects: Bit flags that give the timing point extra effects.

/* Hit Object Syntax:
x,y,time,type,hitSound,(objectParams),hitSample

x: Position of the object. For mania, this signals which key is pressed. 4K left to right: 64, 192, 320, 448
y: Position of the object. In mania, this is always 192.
time: Time when the object is to be hit, in milliseconds from the beginning of the beatmap's audio.
type: Bit flags indicating the type of the object. See Type Bits below.
hitSound: Bit flags indicating the hitsound applied to the object. I won't document this well since it doesn't convert between games well. Check site for more info.
objectParams: Extra parameters specific to the object's type. For mania, there is only the hold, with the special parameter "endTime". This value and its colon is omitted if not used.
hitSample: Information about which samples are played when the object is hit. Like hitSound, I'm not going to document this here as it's not relevant to conversion.


Type Bits:
0: Hit circle
1: Slider start
2: New combo				Not used in Mania?
3: Spinner					Not used in Mania.
4-6: Colour combo stuff. 	Not used in mania.
7: osu!mania hold
